# Conversational AI with Database Access Example
This repository contains the entire runnable project for the Java Magazin article "Ich weiß (nicht), dass ich nichts weiß".

The example shows how to extend the functionality of a conversational AI (in this case OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo) with the ability to query a knowledge base to support its answer with sources.

In order to run this example, you will need to set your API keys for OpenAI and the Vecto Wikipedia Vector Space in `Example.java`.

You can then run it with `mvn exec:java`.
